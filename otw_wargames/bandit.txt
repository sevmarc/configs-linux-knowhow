bandit6:
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

- human-readable
- 1033 bytes in size
- not executable
--------------
find ./inhere/ -type f -size 1033c -exec ls {} \;
looking inside folder 'inhere', for file with size 1033 bytes, and listing results
As units you can use:
    b - for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no suffix is used)
    c - for bytes
    w - for two-byte words
    k - for Kilobytes (units of 1024 bytes)
    M - for Megabytes (units of 1048576 bytes)
    G - for Gigabytes (units of 1073741824 bytes)

bandit8:
- The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word 'millionth'
Commands you may need to solve this level
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

grep "millionth" data.txt

bandit9:
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

hint: https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/piping.php
uniq: when fed a text file or STDIN, outputs the text with adjacent identical lines collapsed to one, unique line of text

"Piping the output into sort organises the output into alphabetical/numerical order. This is a requirement because uniq only matches on repeated lines"

sort data.txt | uniq -c | grep "1 " -> 1 UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR
